# ExtendFault

this is **SUPER** scuffed, is a WIP, and will be messy.
Name changes are to be expected very often.

## Release

This pack will have a release on github and on curseforge when it is released. :)

## License and Legal

 [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

There are a lot of textures in this pack derived from the original MC textures. I am currently checking legality about my license, but this is the **least strict**
license that will be used.

I **HIGHLY** recommend not making any derivatives until an initial release is made.

I also ask you politely not to rehost my packs without asking, if you do rehost them, **message me on discord please <3 (@XCRunnerS#7188)**

### License TLDR

- Give Credit
- Use same License (check back here because it will probably change)

### Credits

I do reference other packs, however almost all of the pack's textures are either created from scratch, or from mojang's textures.
